## Tessel-IO is compatible with Tessel 2

Tessel-IO is an IO Plugin that enables writing JavaScript Robotics programs with Johnny-Five, that run on a Tessel 2. This project was built at [Bocoup](http://bocoup.com)

## IMPORTANT VERSION COMPATIBILTY INFORMATION

| Tessel 2 Firmware Version | Tessel-IO Version |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| >= 0.1.0                  | >= 1.0.0          |
| <= 0.0.16                 | <= 0.11.0         |





## Install & Setup


If you have prior experience with Johnny-Five, this is all you need:

```js
npm install t2-cli tessel-io johnny-five
```

If you have limited prior experience with Johnny-Five, or are generally new to NodeBots, or just want to read more about how this all works together, you'll want to read **[Say 'Hello World' with Johnny-Five on Tessel 2](https://bocoup.com/weblog/say-hello-world-with-johnny-five-on-tessel-2)**


## Boilerplate Program

```js
"use strict";

const five = require("johnny-five");
const Tessel = require("tessel-io");
const board = new five.Board({
  io: new Tessel()
});

board.on("ready", () => {
  // Write your program locally and push to the Tessel 2 when ready!
});
```

## Deploying Your Program To Tessel 2

For testing and development, run in RAM:

```
t2 run <program file name>
```

When your program is ready for deployment, push to flash:


```
t2 push <program file name>
```



## Pin Naming Guide

There are two primary ports on the Tessel2: Port "A" and Port "B". There is also a bank of onboard LEDs which are controllable from a port we are calling "L". Note that "L0" and "L1" should be reserved for system functions (ERR and WLAN) so you should avoid using them. Instead, consider using "L2" and "L3" which are intended to be more informational in nature.

| Port | Number | Johnny-Five Compatible Name |
|------|--------|-----------------------------|
| A    | 0      | `"a0"` or `"A0"`            |
| A    | 1      | `"a1"` or `"A1"`            |
| A    | 2      | `"a2"` or `"A2"`            |
| A    | 3      | `"a3"` or `"A3"`            |
| A    | 4      | `"a4"` or `"A4"`            |
| A    | 5      | `"a5"` or `"A5"`            |
| A    | 6      | `"a6"` or `"A6"`            |
| A    | 7      | `"a7"` or `"A7"`            |
| B    | 0      | `"b0"` or `"B0"`            |
| B    | 1      | `"b1"` or `"B1"`            |
| B    | 2      | `"b2"` or `"B2"`            |
| B    | 3      | `"b3"` or `"B3"`            |
| B    | 4      | `"b4"` or `"B4"`            |
| B    | 5      | `"b5"` or `"B5"`            |
| B    | 6      | `"b6"` or `"B6"`            |
| B    | 7      | `"b7"` or `"B7"`            |
| L    | 0      | `"l0"` or `"L0"`            |
| L    | 1      | `"l1"` or `"L1"`            |
| L    | 2      | `"l2"` or `"L2"`            |
| L    | 3      | `"l3"` or `"L3"`            |

## Examples


There are several [examples](https://github.com/rwaldron/tessel-io/tree/master/eg) of how to use this library in its raw form. Make sure you have [installed the Tessel 2 CLI and provisioned the board first](http://tessel.github.io/t2-start/). After that is complete, you can run any of the examples:

```bash
t2 run eg/onboard-led.js
```
